First operational version of the tracker, together with the traffic generator.

TODO.
-----
0. Debug the kernel, looking at sniffy
1. Implement sensor pruning in som_platform
2. Think: smallest reasonable version -- dimensions? bias towards action as a function of the arbiters?
3. Look at sniffy again: autonomous arbitration?
