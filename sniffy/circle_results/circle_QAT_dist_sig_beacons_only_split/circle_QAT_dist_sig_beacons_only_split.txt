100 runs
circle, circumference=20
beacon width=4

qualitative auto-targeting agents
signal:  distance to target
sensors: beacon sensors + delays

Each run begins with a training period consisting of a random walk (1600 steps),
after which agents are given control authority.

This plot presents separate statistics (mean distance to target over time 
plus-minus std dev) for walks ending at distance<=5 to the target, and for
walks ending at distance>5 from the target.

The plot demonstrates a clear separation between these families in terms of
the ensuing behaviors of the agents: the first family converges to the target,
while the second gets trapped (without converging) in a neighbourhood of the
antipode.

REMARK. In fact, this separation is also visible in the data, with a clear
separation between the two modes of behavior.
