100 runs
circle, circumference=20
beacon width=4

qualitative auto-targeting agents
signal:  0-1 signal (0 if at target, otherwise 1)
sensors: beacon sensors + delays

Each run begins with a training period consisting of a random walk (1600 steps),
after which agents are given control authority.

This plot presents separate statistics (mean distance to target over time 
plus-minus std dev) for walks ending at distance<=5 to the target, and for
walks ending at distance>5 from the target.

The plot shows no clear separation of the results, though:
1) the first class of runs does clearly converge to the target;
2) the second class presents constant behavior (the agents choose not to 
   move).
